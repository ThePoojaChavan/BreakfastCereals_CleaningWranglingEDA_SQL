Business question: What type of Breakfast Cereal is healthy?

I have started with Data Cleaning , followed by Data Wrangling and lastly explored the data to answer the question.
 
1) Data Cleaning:used functions like cast, isnull, min/max (to check for outliers). Replaced outlier values with avg
2) Data Wrangling: Used case statement to update 1) Mfr names 2) Type of Cereal(Hot/Cold). Used round funtion to round the ratings for consistent numeric data
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finally explored the data to answer our business question.  Queried the dataset to find cereals with high presevative content, high sugar content, less fat content, more vitamin/protein content. Explored ratings of different manufacturers.
