Business question: What type of cereal is healthy?

This process is divided into three steps:
1) Data Cleaning:used functions like  cast and isnull(to check for null values), min/max (to check for outliers). Also did feature engineering to calculate mode
2) Data Wrangling: Used case statement to update 1) Mfr names ) Type of Cereal(Hot/Cold). Used round funtion to round the ratings for consistent numeric data
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finally explored the data to answer our business question.  Queried the dataset to find cereals with high presevative content, high sugar content, less fat content, more vitamin/protein content. Explored ratings of different manufacturers.
